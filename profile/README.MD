# <a name="description"> What is Afterburn? </a>

Afterburn is primarily a chat application with features tailored to developers' workflow. This includes things like the whiteboard, a writing space where developers and programmers can collaborate, plan and write code. But there are lots of other things we want Afterburn to be.


**A Post-Coding Hangout** <br>Imagine the app as a virtual after-work hangout for developers. Where you can relax, chat about non-code stuff, or even have friendly coding challenges!<br><br>
**A Decompression Zone** <br>Not just where you can work on projects, but also where you can go after you complete that long, probably stressful coding session. A space to unwind.<br><br>
**A Refueling Station** <br>Also a place to recharge and get inspired before diving back in.<br><br>
**Going Beyond Just Code** <br>We hope to be able to have Afterburn be part of a bigger picture - be a place where devs can share resources or collaborate on new ideas.<br><br>
**Late-Night Brainstorms** <br>A place to spend those late-night coding sessions where the real magic happens. The app becomes a space to capture those ideas and keep the momentum going.<br><br>

# <a name="inspiration"> What Inspired Afterburn? </a>

When naming "Afterburn" we had a few things in mind. We wanted it to be relaxed but full of creative energy.

The Afterburn logo's flame represents that spark that ignites new ideas as well as the collective energy and inspiration that comes from collaboration within the community.

When deciding what kind of project we wanted to work on there were a lot of options, but the idea of Afterburn was our favourite. We were excited about how it could streamline workflow, reduce project roadblocks, spark creativity, foster community, help team cohesion and give a more direct way of sharing knowledge and working together.
